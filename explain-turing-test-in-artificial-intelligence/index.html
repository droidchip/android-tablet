<section><h3>Turing Test, In Artificial Intelligence, A Test Proposed (1950) By The English Mathematician Alan M.</h3><br/><p>The turing test in ai (artificial intelligence) is a method that is used to test the intelligence of a machine through specific inquiries. The turing test, one of the most discussed methods for assessing artificial intelligence (ai), dates back to the 1950s. The original test consists of two human subjects and an autonomous computer.</p><h3>First Proposed By The Visionary British Mathematician Alan Turing In A Landmark 1950 Paper, The Test Provides A Practical (And Pretty Fun) Way To Determine If A Computer Has Achieved Human Levels Of Intelligence.turing Called It The Imitation Game.if A Computer —.Web</h3><br/><p>Various objections have been raised to turing.web Turing emphasized that determining if a machine can think is mostly meaningless.web Alan turing asked himself the same question over six decades ago in his famous article entitled “computing machinery and intelligence” (1950).web</p><h3>A Computer, A Human Interrogator, And A Human Foil.web</h3><br/><p>In fact, turing well understood the need for empirical evidence, proposing what has become known as the turing test to determine if a machine was capable of thinking. In 1950, alan turing introduced a test to check whether a machine can think like a human or not, this test is known as the turing test. In this test, turing proposed that the computer can be said to be an intelligent if it can mimic human response under specific conditions.web</p><h3>In 1950 Turing Sidestepped The Traditional Debate Concerning The Definition Of Intelligence, Introducing A Practical Test For Computer Intelligence That Is Now Known Simply As The Turing Test.</h3><br/><p>The turing test came about in 1950 when british mathematician and codebreaker alan turing wrote a provocative and persuasive article, computing machinery and intelligence, advocating for the.web The turing test is legendary in the field of artificial intelligence.
