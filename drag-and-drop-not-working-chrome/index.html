In this article, we will explore the reasons behind drag and drop not working on Chrome and provide you with solutions to get it working again. </p><p> So, why does drag and drop not work on Chrome? There can be several reasons for this issue. It could be due to a browser extension or add-on conflicting with the drag and drop functionality.
