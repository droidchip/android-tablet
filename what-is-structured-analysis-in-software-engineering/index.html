<section><h3>Web Structured Analysis And Structured Design (Sa/Sd) Is A Software Development Method That Was Popular In The 1970S And 1980S.</h3><br/><p>Web structured analysis and design technique ( sadt) is a systems engineering and software engineering methodology for describing systems as a hierarchy of functions. Structure chart partitions the system into black boxes (functionality of the system is known to the users but inner details are unknown). The method is based on the principle of structured programming, which emphasizes the importance of breaking down a software system into smaller, more manageable components.</p><h3>There Are Two Major Project Phases:</h3><br/><p>Web structured design is a systematic methodology to determine design specification of software. The analyst defines what the system should do before deciding how it should do it. Sadt is a structured analysis modelling language, which uses two types of diagrams:</p><h3>Define Data Objects And Attributes Based On Requirements Elicitation Information Analyze With Stakeholders Relationships Between Data Objects</h3><br/><p>It is a systematic approach, which uses graphical tools that analyze and refine the objectives of an existing system and develop a new system specification which can be easily understandable by user. The basic principles, tools and techniques of structured methodology are discussed in this chapter.
